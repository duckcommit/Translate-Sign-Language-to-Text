# Translate-Sign-Language-to-Text

This project is similar to my last project but adding a social element to it. This program converts sign languages to text by detecting the signs using python and openCV and using TensorFlow to train the model. 

In order to get the images all you have to do is run the program, show your sign and press the letter that it denotes. It will be saved.
